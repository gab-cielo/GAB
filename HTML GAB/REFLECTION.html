<h1> My Reflection </h1>
<p align="center"style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:30;">
In this quarter, I have learned different lessons. From XHTML, list, tables, hyperlinks, and many more. I faced many challenges since this subject is not my forte. There also times when I lack equipments to fully understand each lessons. I'm not a "techy" person that is why I really struggle everytime  we do hands-on activities. But, I really appreciate how our teacher in this subject never gave up. She transfers knowledge to her students gracefully. Even I who is not that good in ICT, manage to understand the topics. For me, I need to put a lot of effort for the next quarter to showcase my abilities, and to apply these knowledge in my everyday life efficiently. To sum things up, I had an amazing experience for the first quarter of our ICT class. Yes it is full of challenges, but we should also acknowlegde the things we learned with the hepl of Mrs. Uminga. May Godbless us all.
